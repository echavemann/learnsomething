# Part 0: Debugging, Logging, and PRs.

## Scenario
It is your first day as a SWE at a trading firm that specializes in trading Oleos, a fictional currency. Your team's intern, during their final week, created this risk tracking utility to help traders keep track of their risk exposure. Unfortunately, the intern has already left for their next internship and you are left to debug and fix the code. The traders tell you that the script is not working as expected and they are losing money because of it. You have been tasked with fixing the script and ensuring that it is working as expected. Consider the following tips:
- Read the code and understand what it is doing - all of the unit tests will pass.
- Use the logging library to help you understand what is happening in the code.

## Instructions
- [x] Add yourself to the `progress.md` file on the main branch. 
- [x] Fork this repo for yourself
- [x] Clone the repo locally (Ensure you are on Branch 0!)
- [x] Navigate to the repository root and use `mkdir build && cd build` to create a build directory and navigate to it
- [x] Use `task build` to build the project, `./TradeRiskTracker` to run the executable, and `task test` to run the tests
- [x] Identify the bug in the script and fix it
- [x] Update unit tests to cover the bug
- [x] Create a PR answering the questions below and send it to your project mentor
