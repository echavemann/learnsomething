# Part 1: Writing Novel Code, Introduction to PyBind

## Scenario

Thanks to your diligent work, on the last step, you have not been fired immediately. The company transfers you to train
under a QR, who immediately sets you to work on building a pricing utility using C++ that he can directly import using
Python. The Python script and pricing formula will be provided to help you with development.

Pricing formula is as follows:
Theoretical Value = (Previous Price * (0.9 + Interest Rate)) * Oleo Constant.You should take all 3 variables as input
floats into your function.

Note: You will need Python Development Headers installed!

## Instructions

- [ ] Read the given code, and attempt to understand it. Ensure Poetry is installed. 
- [ ] Write unit tests FIRST!
- [ ] You are given a working CMakeLists and Taskfile - you need to make the unit tests work and ensure the Python module is emitted correctly.
- [ ] Be sure to account for various edge cases - including zero interest, negative prices, etc.
- [ ] Ensure the provided Python file can import your module without any issues. This will require you to move the generated *.iso.
