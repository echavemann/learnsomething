# Part 3: Solving Performance Issues

## Scenario
You are now asssisting with Market Making Oleos. Due to some changes to legislation, it is now very costly to enter and exit the market. As a result, your team wants you to help them identify the best day to enter and exit the market, where you want to maximize the traded volume over the days. You are given a list of trading volumes, and need to find the optimal trading window. you only need one per list. Note that you can only trade up to the minimum volume of the entry or exit day while you are deployed in the market, otherwise you risk jail time. This must be done very quickly, so there is a runtime limit. (You are not permitted to read the mechanics of the testing system.)
